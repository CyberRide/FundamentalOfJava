METHOD CALL
TO CALL A METHOD IN JAVA, WRITE THE METHOD'S NAME FOLLOWED BY TWO PARENTHESES () 
AND A SEMICOLON; THE PROCESS OF METHOD CALLING IS SIMPLE. 
WHEN A PROGRAM INVOKES A METHOD, THE PROGRAM CONTROL GETS TRANSFERRED TO THE CALLED METHOD. 
YOU HAVE CALLED ME.




Binding
Binding is the linking between method definition and call

Static binding
It takes place before the program is executed
Also called early binding
Binding is resolved at compile time by compiler
It uses object type info for binding
It uses type information for binding
Eg  method overloading



private,  final and static members (methods and variables) use static binding while for virtual methods (In Java methods are virtual by default) binding is done during run time based upon run time object.
Static binding uses Type information for binding
Overloaded methods are resolved (deciding which method to be called when there are multiple methods with same name) using static binding while overridden methods using dynamic binding, i.e, at run time.
    


public class Test{
    void area(float r)
    {
        float a;
        a=3.1416f*r
        System.out.println("Area of circle:" +a);
    }
    void area (float l, float b)
    {
        float a;
        a=l*b;
        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle:" +a;)
    }
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Test= new Test();
        t.area(9.5f,7.8f);
        t.area(3.4f);
    }
